# Hi, I'm Abdullahi👋

I'm a software engineer focused on building **high-quality, user-centric web applications** — from performant, accessible frontends to reliable backend services.

I enjoy working on products that operate at **scale**, handle **complex data**, and have **real-world impact**.

---

##  What I Work On

- Designing and building **modern web UIs** with React, Next, TypeScript, and CSS 
- Turning **complex datasets** into clear, intuitive user experiences
- Building **scalable APIs and services** to support data-heavy applications
- Improving **performance, accessibility, and developer experience**
- Collaborating closely with product, design, and data teams

---

##  Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **React / TypeScript**
- HTML5, CSS3, Tailwind 
- State management (Redux, Zustand)
- Data visualisation (D3)
- Accessibility (WCAG, semantic HTML, keyboard support)

### Backend
- Node.js
- Python
- REST & GraphQL APIs
- Data modelling & validation
- Background jobs & async processing

### Platform & Tooling
- Git, GitHub Actions
- AWS 
- Testing (unit, integration, E2E)
- CI/CD & automated quality checks

##  Things I Care About

- **Performance** — fast products feel better and cost less to run
- **Accessibility by default** — inclusive software scales better
- **Maintainability** — clean systems outlive clever code
- **Real impact** — building things that matter outside the repo
